    <h1>The Journey of "Cold as Fire"</h1>
    <p>As the month of April began, so too did my journey to create my CSC2463 final project. It started with a proposal of what 
        my project would consist of in terms of graphics, sound, and physical computing. I immediately knew I wanted to make a game,
        so I created a plan for a simple platforming game, with tunes synthesized in real time for each state of gameplay. The character 
        which would traverse these platforms would be controlled by a joystick, and bullets would be shot by pressing a button. A red and 
        blue led would indicate whether the player currently has fire or ice powers respectively. Finally, a temperature sensor would be used
        to sense 
    </p>
    <h3>Graphics (p5play and p5.js)</h3>
    <p>I started with the creation of the sprites first because that seemed like the most fun part</p>
    <h3>Sound (tone.js)</h3>
    <p>Admittedly, this part of the project is relatively simple. I started playing notes in an online piano simulator until I found some
        tunes that were suitable for each of my four game states. I wrote down the sequence of notes for each song, made them into sequences
        using tone.js, and had these songs during their respective game states.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I am satisfied with the fruits of my labor, yet there are still some things I would have like to improve. The enemy and player sprites aren't 
        as smooth as I'd like them to be, I couldn't get sound effects to work, and the temperature sensor controlled part of gameplay is, in its 
        current state, really clunky (a game probably shouldn't need a hair dryer to access an aspect of it). However, despite these issues,
        I had a fun time creating my final project and am proud of what I made.
